# midwifery_project
During my Master's program, I developed an application called Birth & Bodyworks as the sole programmer, collaborating closely with designers and the UI/UX team. 
This educational platform was specifically designed for midwifery students and teachers, offering a range of interactive learning experiences, 
including minigames such as multiple-choice quizzes, interactive tasks, and word-matching exercises.
The app also features user authentication integrated with Firebase, enabling students to track their scores and progress while allowing teachers to add new questions and evaluate student performance.
